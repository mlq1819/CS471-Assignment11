1a. Use interactive Haskell
	Got it?

1b. Commands
	Yup
	
1c. There's a book
	nice

2f)
	factorial 5 returns 120, which is indeed the factorial of 5. The inferred type of "factorial" is "(Eq p, Num p) => p -> p", which seems to mean it takes an object p which is both a Num and of class "Eq", and returns another object p which is of the same classes.
	
3) write some code; I wrote some code

4) Run experiments; what happens and why?
	All three return the same values for inputs of 12 and 13, but fact1 returns 0 instead of what is presumably the correct answer (which factorial and fact2 both return). I believe that factorial and fact2 both end up using a larger type than fact1, which uses Int, and due to the differences between these two, Integer ends up used by factorial and fact2. If this is the case, Integer is a more stable/better version of Int. If it is similar to the language Idris that I worked on for a presentation, it is then because Integer can theoretically hold a value of any size, while Int is limited to a maximum value, which could easily be reached through this means.

5. More experiments: factorial (-2) and factorial -2
The first one causes a stack overflow from recursive function calls. The second causes a syntax error, as "-2" is technically of a different type than (-2), since it inspects the "-" separately in that context from the "2".

6. More edits, write a thing and test it
	K, wrote it and tested it

7. More edits, use guards; how many basic types can factG accept? What happens on factG (-2)?
	Assuming "accept" means that it can run using a value of that data type without producing an error, factG can accept two basic types: namely, Int and Integer. This is because it only allows values that can be compared, and it seems to treat Floats as negative values.
	Speaking of which, running factG on (-2) produces the user-defined error of "Exception: neg x".
	
8. More edits, add factI and factE. Type some expressions; what happens and why? Type some more; what happens, and guess why it does?
